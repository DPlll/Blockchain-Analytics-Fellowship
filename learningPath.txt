**Learning Path:**

1. Basic Python Programming: Start with simple programs like printing "Hello World", functions, loops, imports, classes, security precatuions (env./ gitignore), and finally github basics. Project 1: basic code crash course quizez and exam 

2. Learn about Ethereum and blockchain: Watch beginner-friendly tutorials or read articles to get a basic grasp of how Ethereum and transactions work. Very basic idea of what the blockchain actually is and functions and how we can 
use the provided public ledgers to track transactions 

3. APIs and JSON: Learn how to send requests to APIs and handle responses, starting with simple APIs before moving to Etherscan.A basic crash course on the structure of an API and what it's actuall doing when we run code. 
project 1: use blockcypher basic api to retreive the history of a coin using env's, a main.py, and a file with callable functions. 

4. SQLite Database: Learn how to set up a very simple database, then practice inserting, organizing, and retrieving data. 

5. Combine Concepts: Use Python to call the Etherscan API, extract transaction data, and store it in a database.

### **Module 2: Python Basics for Crypto Analytics (Part 2): Virtual Environments, Security, and Logging**
**Objective**: Combine the concepts of logging, virtual environments (venv), and security into a Python development workflow.

**Topics Covered**:
1. **Creating Virtual Environments (venv)**:
   - How to create and activate a virtual environment using `python -m venv`.
   - Installing dependencies using `pip`.
   - Managing a `requirements.txt` file.
   
2. **Common Security Practices**:
   - Using `.env` files to store sensitive data like API keys.
   - Securing Python projects by using `.gitignore` to hide sensitive files (e.g., API keys, configuration files).
   
3. **Logging in Python**:
   - Introduction to logging: why and how it’s used in development.
   - Setting up a logger in Python.
   - Logging levels: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`.
   - Logging to console and to files.
   
4. **Integrating Logging with the Project**:
   - Logging critical information like API requests, errors, and key actions within the program.
   - Properly organizing logs for easy debugging and tracking.

**Activity**:
1. Create and activate a virtual environment for the project.
2. Install necessary libraries (e.g., `requests` for API calls).
3. Implement logging to track basic program flow, such as logging successful API calls or errors when making requests.
4. Securely store the API key using a `.env` file and configure the program to load it securely.

### **Module 3: Working with VS Code for Python Development**
**Objective**: Teach students how to effectively use Visual Studio Code for Python development and file management.

**Topics Covered**:
1. **Basic File Management**:
   - Organizing and managing Python scripts in VS Code.
   - Creating and navigating through directories.
2. **Setting Up Python in VS Code**:
   - Installing the Python extension.
   - Running Python scripts directly from VS Code.
3. **Integrated Terminal**:
   - Using the terminal to activate virtual environments and run scripts.

**Activity**: Set up a simple project in VS Code, run a Python script, and manage virtual environments from within the terminal.

### **Module 4: Introduction to APIs**
**Objective**: Understand the basic structure of APIs and how to interact with them using Python.

**Topics Covered**:
1. **API Basics**:
   - What is an API, and how do APIs work?
   - Understanding `GET` and `POST` requests.
   - Introduction to JSON and parsing API responses.
2. **Making API Requests**:
   - Using Python's `requests` library to call APIs.
   - Understanding status codes and handling errors.
3. **Authentication**:
   - How to authenticate API requests with API keys.
   - How to handle API rate limits and timeouts.

**Activity**: Send an API request to a public cryptocurrency price API and parse the response to retrieve and display the current price of Ethereum.

**Topics Covered**:
1. **Setting Up the Etherscan API**:
   - Register for an API key on Etherscan.
   - Overview of Etherscan’s API documentation.
