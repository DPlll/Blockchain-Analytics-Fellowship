Crypto Analytics Fellowship 

Student Goals: Create a crypto tracking application project and roadmap for the potential future course and be able to get kinks out of the way for future students.  

Student Tasks: Reasearch, to figure out how if possible to track bitcoin using a private self created code base utilizing some basic cryto apiâ€™s and other tools.  

Specific Expectations: Figure out whether this is a probable course for students to take and if it is possible. If possible, create a code base that can track bitcoin transactions and create a road map (list of useful skills student will need) inorder to complete the course if chosen to be a viable course.
