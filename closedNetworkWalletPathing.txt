Node Connections
The wallets are connected as follows:
Root Node: v1 (Root Wallet)
Intermediate Transfers: v1 sends ETH to several intermediate wallets (v2, v3, v4, v5, v6, v7, v8).
End Nodes: v9 and v10 (Cold Storage) are the final destination nodes with no outgoing connections.

Sample Path Outline
Root Node to Intermediate Wallets:
v1 → v2, v1 → v3, v1 → v4

Mixing Between Intermediate Wallets:
Intermediate wallets send ETH to other intermediate wallets to simulate mixing.
v2 → v5, v3 → v6, v4 → v7/v8

Intermediate Wallets to Cold Storage:
Finally, intermediate wallets send ETH to cold storage:
v6/v5 → v9, v7 → v10, v8 → v9
